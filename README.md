This repository showcases a highly efficient and cost-effective method for fine-tuning Google's Gemma 3.4B language model specifically for customer support applications. By leveraging accessible techniques from Unsloth, we demonstrate how to achieve a powerful, specialized AI assistant capable of handling a wide range of customer inquiries, all for an incredibly low cost.

## üöÄ Quick Start

You can immediately interact with and utilize the fine-tuned model directly on Hugging Face:

## üí° How It Works

The project leverages a combination of efficient fine-tuning techniques, potentially including parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods, to adapt the base Gemma 3.4B model. The core idea is to train only a small subset of the model's parameters or add small, trainable layers, significantly reducing computational costs and training time while achieving impressive performance gains for the specific customer support domain. The Hugging Face `transformers` library and potentially `unsloth` for further optimization are key components in this process.

## üìà Model Performance (Refer to Medium Article for Details)

While specific metrics are elaborated in the Medium article, the fine-tuned model demonstrates significant improvements in its ability to generate contextually relevant and accurate responses for customer support queries compared to its base counterpart.

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Installation (Optional)

If you wish to replicate the fine-tuning process or run the model locally, you will typically need:

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-repo-name.git) # Replace with your actual repo name
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
2.  **Install necessary libraries:**
    ```bash
    pip install transformers torch accelerate peft datasets trl # and any other dependencies mentioned in the article
    ```
3.  **Follow the steps outlined in the Medium article** to prepare your dataset and execute the fine-tuning script.
